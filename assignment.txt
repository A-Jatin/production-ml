# Senior MLE Take-Home Assignment

## Introduction:

As a Senior MLE, your scope of work is 80% IC and primary responsibility is to transform research implementations into production-ready systems to handle enterprise-scale data volumes for synthetic data generation.

### **Objective:**

Today’s task is an example of your day to day work with deliberate ambiguity to allow you to showcase your understanding of what it means to have production ready code. You are given a set of research code (algorithm) and are tasked to scale it to 1B records and make it production ready.

### **Assignment:**

**Task 1 (Dataset):** For this assignment, you can use the single column “Amount”, where you will need to scale it to 1B records (from ~50k rows in the Credit.csv dataset below) for the task.

[Credit.csv](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e953e31d-df73-4ade-980a-411204b57188/f0c78d01-2cdb-4620-9238-7e56e402480b/Credit.csv)

**Task 2 (Scalable, production ready code):** Implement a 1B records scalable and production ready code of VGM.

- You may learn more on VGM in the CTGAN paper below:
    - https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/254ed7d2de3b23ab10936522dd547b78-Paper.pdf
        - specifically section 4.2 “**Mode-specific Normalization**”
- We have provided a runnable research code of VGM that is neither scalable nor production ready. You may use the Google Colab code below as an initial starting point.

### **Deliverables:**

- Written explanation of your thought process in a readme (please use simple English).
- A link to the GitHub repository containing all production source code.
    - You’re expected to provide a production repo, i.e., folders and files - not just a notebook.
    - However, you should use a notebook to call your code for demonstration purposes.
        - Be sure to include the timing of the operation and any necessary comments to explain what it’s doing. The time objective would be minimally less than 10 minutes.
    - Do not name it **Betterdata** or anything related to this name.

### **Notes:**

- Scalability, speed and correctness of the code are all required. Ideally you can achieve all 3, but if there is a trade off, explain why and how you plan to handle it.
- Most ML production steps have been intentionally left out. You will also be evaluated on identifying the best practices and implementing them.
- You are encouraged to use any suitable library, framework, database, data structure or tool for this task, part of the assignment is to evaluate how you pick the right tools as well.
